README
This program takes minimum one input under quotes and returns the list in descending alphabetical order. To start with my program, I created five local variables, int i and j (for my array index), char currentChar (this will hold first character to current character and go to the next one). I also created three indexes and they are charIndex, sepArrayIndex and bufferIndex all initialized to 0. These help me irritiate through each index when I use string buffer, goes through my current character array, and sepArray index was used for my sorting algorithm when I'm using diffenrent arrays to use strcmp with. Lastly was my wordCount where it reads the number of strings in the array, not to be confused with strlen.I mallocate my strBuffer and create array of seperated strings from input. For my delimter check I used a while loop making sure every index is an alphabet, if not goes to the next char index. I copied the strings in the buffer into the array of strings. Then I finish of with my sorting algorithm using the index of [j] and [j+1], where I swap them using strcpy. I use a for loop at the very end using making sure i < wordCount where it prints out the sorted list of strings.
